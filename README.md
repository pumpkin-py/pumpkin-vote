# Pumpkin Vote

A set of [pumpkin.py](https://github.com/pumpkin-py) modules.

**HELP WANTED**

This repository will be new place for old [Amadeus](https://github.com/Czechbol/Amadeus) cogs. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/pumpkin-py/pumpkin-vote/issues) to see what is to be done and what is being worked on.
